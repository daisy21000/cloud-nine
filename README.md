## Introduction
Cloud Nine is a project I made for the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp. This project is made with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 5, and shows what I have learned in this course. This is a mental health website that provides mental health info, tips to reduce stress and information about trusted organizations. This website is accessible for all users and is fully responsive to accommodate all screen sizes.
