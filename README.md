## Introduction
Cloud Nine is a project I made for the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp. This project is made with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 5, and shows what I have learned in this course. This is a mental health website that provides mental health info, tips to reduce stress and information about trusted organizations. This website is accessible for all users and is fully responsive to accommodate all screen sizes.

## Features

**Navbar and hero section**

The navbar is a Bootstrap navbar that is fixed to the top and collapses on small devices. It has been made transparent on larger screens using JavaScript to make it look more appealing and has a background color on scroll. The hero section has an image of the sky as a background to match with the theme of the website, a header and to CTA buttons to help direct the user. It also has a parallax scrolling effect to make it appear smooth.
